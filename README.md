# aiPlayground

Simple games to compare different ai implementations

How to run:
 - Each game should have a file called game.py, to run execute "python game.py" in terminal
 - In a function called ai() player1 and player2 should be seen with comments
 - Change these to whatever Python file you add for an ai
 - Python file must have function called ai(args) so player acts as an abstract class
